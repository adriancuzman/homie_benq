This is a simple Sketch to control Benq RS232 enabled projectors using an ESP8266

It is using marvinrogers really cool HOMIE Firmware (v1.5 by now as long as v2 doesn't support SSL)

To connect the esp to the projector use a rs232 driver chip such as MAX232 and connect it to the additional Serial2 pins of the ESP
